    <h2 class="center">About This Breed</h2>
    <p class="center">This breed was created to have the perfect combination of size and strength. Originally used as bait dogs, this versitle breed are now utilized for herding, therapy, law enforcement or a typical house dog.  They are personally my favorite breed because of their intelligence and the fact that you will never see two Pitbulls that look exactly alike even if the have the same parents.
